# Assembler-r_a_mv4
- This is an extension to my Computing Machinery from Scratch project, after building an advanced arithmetic machine (called Repeated  Arithmetic Machine aka r_a_m) and in version4 (r_a_mv4) we succesfully implemented 
**Machine-Code Programming** by storing machine code instructions in the program memory.
- So next logical step was to go up the computing stack from machine code to language having instructions in an english like language, called Mnemonics, so after mapping all the machine codes to
 mnemonics we get -**The Assembly Language**.
