## Version 0 
- This version is the first ever implementation of an assembler for a custom built Assembly language instruction set for a custom built computing machine.
  
- In this version i will make several sub-versions as i progress and will try to make the language translation logic or mnemonic-machine code mapping better as i progress.
  
- By end of this version i aim to map the entire machine-code instruction functionalities to corresponding assembly language instructions or mnemonics and learn more about the hardware-software interface of the computing stack.
  
- So once this version is done, we will be able to think about our code and operation we want the machine to perform in terms of english-like assembly language instead of getting bogged down in working out machine code program by looking at machine code instruction format (it is Cool, writing a program in 0's and 1's but it is a headache for complex operations, believe me! ðŸ˜Š)
