## asm-v0 - The First Assembler
- 🏗️ Foundational Build
  -  This marks the very first implementation of an assembler for a custom-built Assembly Language designed specifically for my custom computing machine.
  
- 🔄 Incremental Sub-Versions
  -  Throughout this version series (v0.1, v0.2, v0.3, ...), the assembler evolves - improving translation logic, syntax checking, and mnemonic-to-machine code mapping
  
-⚙️ Learning by Building 
  - Each sub-version deepens understanding of how hardware logic meets software abstraction, reinforcing the hardware–software interface at the core of the computing stack.
  
- 🧠 Goal
  - By the end of Version 0, the entire machine-code instruction set will be mapped to its assembly mnemonics, allowing direct program writing in human-readable form.

- 💬 Why It Matters
  - It’s awesome to handcraft a program in 0’s and 1’s, but once operations grow complex, writing machine code manually becomes a headache 😅.The assembler makes it possible to think and write in English-like Assembly Language instead  bridging human intent with machine logic.
