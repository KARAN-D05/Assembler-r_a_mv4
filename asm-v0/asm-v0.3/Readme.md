**In extension to my r_a_mv4, this project aims to build an assembly language which maps to the machine code instrcutions**
**and this assembler will take that Assembly language program as an input and output the machine code that will provide same functionality.**

## Version 1:- 
- In it i am trying to map machine code instrcutions to mnemonics, as for programming the machine we need machine codes but they are very hard or difficult to look for in the instruction format manually and our program becomes susceptible to error.
- Also when finding the logic for a certain operation or task to be performed by the machine it is easier to think in terms of high level english like language rather than looking at machine codes.
- In this version I will make a basic program where you enter your assembly command one by one and you generate the corresponding machine code. 

**Machine Code -> mnemonic Mapping**
- We will try to find patterns in our machine code instructions and will map them to suitable mnemonic(english word defining machine code instruction functionality easier for humans to understand).
